    "ai": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that involves developing computer programs to perform tasks that are unique to human intelligence. Subfields of AI include producing and understanding human language, visual perception, and decision-making. Popular examples of AI include YouTube's and Netflix's algorithms to recommend videos to its users, robots taught to win against humans at games like chess and Go, phone assistants like Siri, and the development of self-driving cars.",
    "big_data": "Big data is a concept in which large amounts of information are gathered in order to find patterns and connections within the data, and this data can then be used by AI. Big data is used in marketing to personalize suggestions in online shopping or in cars' GPS systems to provide better routes for its drivers."

Machine learning uses math to make its predictions, but in the following example we'll only explain it at a high-level."

We can collect different pictures and define different features like tail length, snout length, and pupil roundness. We'll look at different species of cats and dogs, collect data from the images, and label each image as \"cat\" or \"dog.\""

Training data is used to create our model — in our example, we will use it to teach a computer if the image it's viewing is \"cat\" or \"dog.\" Testing data is used to evaluate our model and see how accurate it is. Data is split like this so the computer cannot 'memorize' the answers — much like how a teacher wouldn't use the same exact questions from a practice test on the real exam."

As we show the model more pictures, it can learn patterns to define the two animals — that cats have very narrow pupils and a short snout, while dogs have long snouts and short tails. The more data it is shown, the better it can identify the animals."

In our example, let's say we show the model new images of cats and dogs. It will make its own predictions on whether it is looking at a cat or a dog. How many it can identify correctly will define the model's 'accuracy.'"

You can also expand the model to include more animals, or learn whether the image it's looking at is even an animal at all. These kinds of problems require more complex models."
